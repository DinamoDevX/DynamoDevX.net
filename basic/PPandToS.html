            <h3>Privacy Policy (dont ask me why i abbreviate it as 'pp')</h3>
            <p>Privacy isn't just a thing for me to give you a consent popup and just leave you tracked, privacy is one of my top most favourite (no its not 'favorite' you dumb american) hobbies to research. This site is fully FOSS (who cares), doesn't use third party tools (2x who cares), and doesn't store a single cookie (if youre hungry thats on u fr. also it's "Biscuit" not "Cookie" 🇬🇧).</p>
            <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
            <p>Just use this site for anything thats in the boundaries of your country's laws. If you use this site for illegal purposes, I am not forced to be taken to court unless the problem is with the website and is not your fault (most likely to be held true). I have all rights (i didn't? 😱😲) to change the ToS at any time, any condition, without notifications (i am too busy browsing drug sit- uhhh... nothing, to know how to send notifications).</p>
